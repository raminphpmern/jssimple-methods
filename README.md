JS Simple demo functionalities

Example 1 : tun-on-off-light.html
Kindly Switch On/Off to make the bulb glow 

As we all know JavaScript can change HTML attribute values.
Used "document.getElementById" to locate the Image Src attribute and used "Substring" and "lastIndexOf" to extract the characters from the Src attribute & finally used "Includes" method to find the specified string from the src

In this case the demo will showcase Using JavaScript how to change the value of the src (source) attribute of an image to make the light & switch On/Off.


Happy Codingggggg......
